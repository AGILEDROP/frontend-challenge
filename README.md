<h1>Agiledrop Front-end Challenge</h1>
<p>If you want to be considered as a candidate for front-end developer, you will have to complete the following tasks.</p>
<p><strong>If you know what you're doing, this task shouldn't take you longer than 2h.</strong></p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since all our front-end developers work locally, you will have to be able to install the site on your computer. You can use MAMP (OS X), WAMP (Windows) or any other tool that you're used to.</li>
<li>You must have a basic knowledge of GIT.</li>
<li>We probably don't have to tell you that you must know CSS, Javascript etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Your first task is to set the page locally:
<ul>
<li>Fork this repository and clone the code to your computer.</li>
<li>Install database which is in root folder of the repository.</li>
<li>Update file sites/default/local.setting.inc using the instructions in that file.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have this ready and the page is opening on your localhost go on the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Style the front page using the provided psd. Only style elements that appear on the page (there is more items in psd).</li>
<li>If some elements have different order, just style them where they are positioned.</li>
<li>Header should be styled in a way that when you scroll down it sticks to the top. There is no design for that, but black background with white links should do it.</li>
<li>Also style one of the news - click on it and style the right sidebar. Everything else should be more or less styled already.</li>
<li>Please have in mind that this should look OK on mobile as well.</li>
</ol>
<h2>When done</h2>
<ol>
<li>Commit and Push your code to your new repository.</li>
<li>Send us a pull request. We will review your code and get back to you.</li>
</ol>
